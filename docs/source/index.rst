Welcome to DenMune's documentation!
===================================

DenMune a clustering algorithm that can find clusters of arbitrary size, shapes and densities in two-dimensions. Higher dimensions are first reduced to 2-D using the t-sne. The algorithm relies on a single parameter K (the number of nearest neighbors). The results show the superiority of DenMune. Enjoy the simplicty but the power of DenMune.
